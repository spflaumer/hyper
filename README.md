## An HTTP Server made small yet fast
At least in theory.
The aim of this server is to be fast and small.
But also:
 - [x] Support HTTP
    - [x] Multithreaded with pthreads
    - [ ] Routing 
 - [ ] Support HTTPS
 - [ ] Support FTP
 - [ ] Config with TOML
 - [ ] Authentication

perhaps even more features will be added in the future.
